## Development

Run a static file server at the root of the project. Example:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Deployment

We're using Cloud Foundry. If you're in 18F, and have questions about deployment, ask someone in DevOps.

If you're not in 18F, you can deploy this however you like. It's just a static site.
